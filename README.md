# cat-dog classifier

this project was born from this [one tweet](https://twitter.com/sonnen_konig/status/1657711956743139332?s=46&t=tdKjigfuSqFFkKoOpXqGkg) that said that most animals can be classified as dogs/not dog. now while i do agree wholeheartedly with this statement,  i don't think they went far enough with their idea. i propose that you can classify every animal as some combination of dog, cat, crocodile, bear, butterfly, duck, . using machine learning algorithms on a training set of 3500+ images, this projects aims to do just that for common animals, as well as images uploaded by users.

## methodology

first, i downloaded the [Dog and Cat Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/dog-and-cat-detection?resource=download) and [Pre-processed Snake Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameeharahman/preprocessed-snake-images) datasets from Kaggle.
